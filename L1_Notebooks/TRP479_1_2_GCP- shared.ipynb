These comprise practical tips based on practices used by professional programmers that help them write better programs that are easier to understand and share with others. To say it differently, there are many ways to learn to program, and we want to help you learn how to program effectively!\n","\n","This week our good programming practice (GCP) is about selecting \"good\" variable names. \n","\n","## Some \"not-so-good\" variable names\n","\n","To illustrate the point, consider a few not-so-good examples below."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"VU0oQtXqZRIO"},"outputs":[],"source":["s = \"101533\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"i5cGu6_yZRIT"},"source":["or"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Q2JRJoNoZRIV"},"outputs":[],"source":["sid = \"101533\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"feG6pqcpZRIX"},"source":["Any idea what these variables are for?

Be clear and concise. \n","\n","2. Be written in English. A general coding practice is to write code with variable names in English, as that is the most likely common language between programmers. Thus, variable names such as ``muuttuja`` (which is also not a good name on other levels) should be avoided.\n","\n","3. Not contain special characters. Python supports use of special characters by way of various encoding options that can be given in a program.

Not conflict with any [Python keywords](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/keywords-in-python), such as ``for``, ``True``, ``False``, ``and``, ``if``, or ``else``.
